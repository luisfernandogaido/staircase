### how to use

Download the appropriate binary of your OS in bin folder. In terminal type, for example:

```
staircase -n 4 -j 1,3,5
```

The higher N, more time will be necessary to discover the possibilities.
So, be careful. You probably will freeze your PC.
You can accelerate the results trying something like this:

```
staircase -n 20 -j 1,2,4 > out.txt
```

This solution is not the most elegant, however it shows the paths and is interesting.
